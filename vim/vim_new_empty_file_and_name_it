How do you open another [No Name] buffer like the one on startup?


There are many ways to open a new buffer with no name, the simplest of which is :new.

:new will create a split window with an unnamed buffer.

:enew will open one in the current window.

:vnew will open one in a vertically split window.

:tabnew will open one in a new tab.
