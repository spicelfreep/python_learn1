TEXT:
    Through you may not pay attention to it unless you're sick, you're always breathing more heavily from one nostril than the other.

    During the day, the sides switch and the other nostril goes into 'work mode', but why?

    This process is automated by the aptly named autonomic nervous system, which is the same system that controls many things your body does all by itself such as digestion an heart rate.


    For your nose, this system controls your 'nasal cycle', so that each nostril operates effectively.

    The nasal cycle happens, according to the US National Library of Medicine, several times during the day, and is only brought to your attention if your nose is clogged up more than usual.

    In order to open one side of your nose and close the others, your body inflates tissue with blood.


    "increased blood flow causes congestion in one nostril for about 3 to 6 hours before switching to the other side. There is also increased congestion when one is lying down, which can be especially
    noticeable when the head is turned to one side," Jennifer Shu reports for CNN.

    It's believed that this cycle helps round out your sense of small.
