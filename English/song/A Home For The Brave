Fire in your sleep 
Colder you preach
You see though allies
See fields in your mind

The world spins and weeps
For those words you won's keep
The galaxy sleeps
You are fallen and weak

There's a clock
There's a grave
There's a home
'For the brave
There's a tree
There's a spire
Where's the funeral pyre

Those names on a page 
Shrivel and age
When all that you meant
Was borrowed and spent
The world spins you weep
'For Those words you won't keep
You gallantry sleeps
When you fall you are weak

There's a clock
There's a grave
There's a home
'For the brave
There's a tree
There's a spire
but no funeral pyre

There's a clock
There's a grave
There's a home
'For the brave
There's a tree
There's a spire
but no funeral pyre
