Fire in your sleep 
Colder your preach
You see thought allies
See fields in your mind

The world spins and weeps
For those words you won's keep
The galaxy sleeps
You are fallen and weak

There's a clock
There's a grave
There's a home
'For the brave
There's a tree
There's a spire
Where's the funeral pyre

there's a home
for the brave
there's a tree
there's a spire
but no funeral pyre
