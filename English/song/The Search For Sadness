Neo Retros


The winter's freshness turns to rain
A windswept summer carries names
To distant shores where naked no ones lie

A silhouette through windowpanes
A harlot feeds her hiddened shame
The city's stars are narrowed hardened eyes

Though the seasons will change there's a mask on your face
Hiding sadness hiding anger hiding pain

All the seasons must change but for you they're the same
There's the anger there's the hours there's the pain

~~
The search for misery goes on
In peace the spectre of the bomb
A melancholic melody resounds

Borders come and borders fall
But you're the one who's building walls
And every little whisper's like a call

Though the seasons will change there's a mask on your face
Hiding sadness hiding anger hiding pain

All the seasons must change but for you they're the same
There's the anger there's the hours there's the pain
