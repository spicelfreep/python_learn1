Neo Retros


The winter's freshness turns to rain
A windswept summer carries names
To distant shores where naked no ones lie
冬天的清新转眼就下雨
风吹过的夏天带着名字
去遥远的没有赤身裸体地躺着的人的海岸

A silhouette through windowpanes
A harlot feeds her hiddened shame
The city's stars are narrowed hardened eyes
透过窗玻璃的轮廓
一个妓女加深了她隐藏的羞耻
这座城市的星星是眯着的坚强的眼睛

Though the seasons will change there's a mask on your face
Hiding sadness hiding anger hiding pain

All the seasons must change but for you they're the same
There's the anger there's the hours there's the pain

~~
The search for misery goes on
In peace the spectre of the bomb
A melancholic melody resounds
对痛苦的寻找还在继续
和平中，炸弹的幽灵还在
忧郁的旋律回荡着

Borders come and borders fall
But you're the one who's building walls
And every little whisper's like a call
每一个小小的耳语都像是一次呼喊（形容每个人的一点点贡献积累就能产生很大的反响？）

Though the seasons will change there's a mask on your face
Hiding sadness hiding anger hiding pain

All the seasons must change but for you they're the same
There's the anger there's the hours there's the pain
