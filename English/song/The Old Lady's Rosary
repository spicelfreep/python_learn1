老妇人的念珠

Neo Retros

You're lonely 
living lasts too long
Modern life is no place for you
And everything is wrong

Why worry 
There's so much you can do
Just wait for the big sleep to call you
You'll make tomorrow's news

But oh
When you're empty, you blow it away
When life is not your side, for time you must pray

There's laughter 
And maybe they're laughing at you
Imprisoned wizened vision of you  (被监禁的干涸的你的幻象)
There're something trapped in you

You're living 
but why you cannot say
Those rituals chat shows slumbers through days (那些仪式聊天节目沉睡了好几天)
Will hide your death-warmed face


But oh
When you're empty, you blow it away
When life is not your side, for time you must pray

But oh
When you're empty, you blow it away
When life is not your side, for time you must pray
