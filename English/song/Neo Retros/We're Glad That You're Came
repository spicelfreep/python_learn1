Forces of good make me feel numb
Powdered up messiahs go beat your drum
It's making the deaf through channel benign
Panels of speakers desecrate my mind 
How do you feel a hologram said
Better and better with the of fswitch pressed

There's hopefuls in hordes for now they're adored
But hounded tomorrow sing
It's lucky you came when you came
And they knew you would come when you came
And they're glad that you came when you came

But nobody knows you by name
So when did it start and when will it end
Cos when you're the clique down here you must pretend
The pap and the pop the puppets all drop
A blank manifesto leads the empty crocks
So learn to revise and learn to revere

The leader among us is your friend your peer
Forever the twain shall meet when the blind
Deaf dumb among us sing
It's lucky you came when you came
And They're glad that you came when you came
But nobody knows you by name
