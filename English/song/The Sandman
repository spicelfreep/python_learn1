Neo Retros

Sandman sprinkle your sand
Send me away from this land
Century's gone
Battle's been won
But most of my life's out of hand
Sandman shut off this world
Maybe someday I'll be good
Will you help
Sink into sleep
Away from the cruel mockingbirds

Sandman come back tonight
in my dreams there'll be someone by my side
Sandman end all this pain
While my mind spins across the milkyway

Paper  bag people don't care
Gasping my last breath of air
The sandman found peace
In some far-off dream
And I don't have to be to just be

Sandman come back tonight
In my dreams there'll be someone by my side
Sandman end all the pain
While my mind spins across the milkyway

Sandman come back tonight
In my dreams there'll be someone by my side
Sandman end all the pain
While my mind spins across the milkyway

Sandman come back tonight
In my dreams there'll be someone by my side
Sandman end all the pain
While my mind spins across the milkyway
