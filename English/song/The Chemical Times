Smells like a monday
Asleep on a train
Sign out from senses play games       (退出感官游戏)
Everyone's happy
No islands no strays                  (没有岛屿没有流浪者)
Turn into emptiness pays              (化为空虚付出)

Don't ever cry, don't ever cry        (永远不要哭)

Fading faces fade to one in the earth and sky and sun.    (在地球、天空、太阳上消失的脸，变成了一个)
The chemical times Chemical time beautiful lives(化学维系着美丽的生活)beautiful lies（美丽的谎言）

As the starlight strikes a pose over rows of council homes (当星光照射在一排排市政住宅上时)
The chemical time Chemical time beautiful lives beautiful lies 

Smileaholics jump into screens                            (微笑狂跳进屏幕)
Well, everyone's happy it seems
Feeling empowered in powderd of dreams                    (在碎梦中感到被赋予了力量)
Consciously floating downstream                           (有意识地漂浮在下游)

Don't ever cry, don't ever cry        (永远不要哭)

From the everlasting shame to the park bench with your name.(从永恒的耻辱到公园的长椅上写着你的名字。）
The chemical time Chemical time beautiful lives beautiful lies 

To a breeze they breathe as one                 (他们像一个人一样呼吸)
The chemical time Chemical time beautiful lives beautiful lies 

Fading faces fade to one in the earth and sky and sun.    (在地球、天空、太阳上消失的脸，变成了一个)
The chemical time Chemical time beautiful lives beautiful lies 

Seen an island in the sun
To a breeze they breathe as one
Incredible times
The chemical times beautiful lives beautiful lies 

Smileaholics  微笑狂
Shopaholics   购物狂
powderd       粉状，碎的
