Hotel California(Remastered) - Eagles

Don Feil/Don Henley/Glenn Frey/Donald Henley

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas*, rising up trough the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering* light 
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission* bell
And I was  thinking to myself
This could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way 
There were voices down the corridor*
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face

Plenty of room at he hotel California
Any time of year
Any time of year
You can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany* twisted*
She got the Mercedes* bends*
She got a lot of pretty pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard*
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the captain*
Please bring me my wine
He said
We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
And still those voices are calling form far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotal California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face

They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surpise
What a nice surpise
Bring your alibis*
Mirrors on the ceiling* the pink champage on ice
And she said
We are all just prisoners here of our own device
And in the master's chamber*s
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remeber
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place
I was before
Relax said the night man
