Neo Rethros


There's no globe the sun is near
Belive what you belive in but
The answer's here
We're motion less the earth is flat
And if you see a distant lighthouse
Can you answer how's that
Gravity is just a tool and
Science keeps you grounded
But don't be a fool
You know the world's 
Deceived except the few
Can you hear the round
Earth sceptics calling out for you

They say don't walk too far or you will drop
F-f-falling through the cosmos so you'd better stop
Because the world is flat and that's that say
That Australia ain't down under
It's a bike ride away hey

The movie blonde the chief the king
The leader hanging lifeless
You must stop and think
Just close your eyes and find the truth
Or those aliens and those masons
They will come for you

They say don't walk too far or you will drop
F-f-falling through the cosmos so you'd better stop
Because the world is flat and that's that say
That Australia ain't down under
It's a bike ride away hey

A syndicate a smoking man
Send explosions under oceans can you read their plan
That plane that crashed those bodies lost
They define it on their mission as collateral cost

They say don't walk too far or you will drop
F-f-falling through the cosmos so you'd better stop
Because the world is flat and that's that say
That Australia ain't down under
It's a bike ride away hey

They say don't walk too far or you will drop
F-f-falling through the cosmos so you'd better stop
Because the world is flat and that's that say
That Australia ain't down under
It's a bike ride away hey
